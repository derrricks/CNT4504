# Project 1 - Iterative Socket Server:
  - This project requires the implementation of an iterative (single-threaded) server for use in a client-server configuration to examine, analyze, and study the effects an iterative server has on the efficiency (average turn-around time) of processing client requests.
  
  - Create two programs:
      1) An iterative (single-threaded) server:
        -  that accepts requests from clients and handle one client request at a time (serially)
      3) a multi-threaded client capable of spawning numerous client sessions that connect to the server

# Project 2 - Concurrent Socket Server:
